# Minek van szezonja

An app created to get familiar with working with React, while creating something useful.

My developer journey take me through 
- [x] Learn the basics of React with [Maximillian Schwartzm√ºller from AcadeMind](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-82cd4e4a-9002-42a7-a2c0-170faa7f82d0/)
- [x] Created the whole site with a pretty basic look and content (v1)
- [x] The previously mentioned Udemy course got re-recorded to include React v16 features and hooks, so I've started a rewrite as well
- [x] Wanted to get my hands dirty with PWAs, get some Google Analytics involved and generally some better looking UI
- [x] After all data was added the new version went live (v2):
- [x] Technology evolved, there was a bunch of uncovered things, so I went and finished the [Zero to Mastery React](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-96c23343-5e2c-499f-a3fd-b06180d07db0/) course as well

What my future plans technology-wise?

- [ ] Firestore
- [ ] Build pipelines

And what does it mean feature-wise?
- [ ] Basket and seasonal list (to collect favourite veggies after sign in)
- [ ] Admin pages to manage plants
- [ ] Filters, better search
- [ ] Location data to suggest local markets
- [ ] Multilanguage + Separated database by countries
- [ ] Themes
